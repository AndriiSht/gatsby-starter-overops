## Introduction
The Classic Dashboard is a hub for catching, prioritizing and fixing critical errors in your staging and production applications.

The Dashboard comprises three main panes - Events List, Events Chart and Views Pane. The combination of these components allows you to investigate errors that impact your application. Open the event to determine its root cause from the Automated Root Cause page.

The Events List and Events Chart visualize the events selected within the [current Timeframe](https://doc.overops.com/docs/the-dashboard-overview#section-setting-timeframes) and [View](https://doc.overops.com/docs/the-dashboard-overview#section-views-and-labels).

Events presented within the Dashboard include Exceptions (caught, uncaught and swallowed), Log Errors and Warnings, HTTP Errors, Timers and custom events. In addition, the Dashboard features a mechanism for examining specific types of errors and applications, and a labeling method for sorting, tracking, and filtering items.

## Views Pane
Views and labels provide a simple yet powerful mechanism to examine specific types of errors and applications.

In addition to the default [Dashboard View](https://doc.overops.com/docs/view-panes#section-view-folders), you can use the deployment/ops views or [create your own custom View](https://doc.overops.com/docs/view-panes#section-creating-custom-views).
